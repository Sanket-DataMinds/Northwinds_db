# üìä Insights & Observations
-üß© Easy Level Insights
The majority of employees are associated with specific regions and reports-to hierarchies, indicating a well-defined organizational structure.

There is a consistent pattern of orders placed by customers from specific regions, reflecting strong customer retention in certain markets.

Basic joins between tables like orders, employees, and customers demonstrate how relational databases enable a holistic view of transactions and company operations.

-‚öôÔ∏è Medium Level Insights
Analysis of order details reveals that some products are repeatedly ordered together, which could help in identifying product bundling opportunities.

By calculating the total revenue per order or product, we can identify high-performing items and customers, useful for targeted marketing and inventory decisions.

Medium-difficulty queries involving aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, AVG) help to summarize financial data quickly and support strategic decisions like promotions or bulk discount offerings.

-üöÄ Hard Level Insights
Complex joins and subqueries reveal customer behavior trends, such as average order value and top purchasing customers over time.

Queries that analyze supplier contributions help in identifying key suppliers and optimizing the supply chain.

Advanced queries also simulate real-time reporting, such as identifying the top 5 products or the most profitable months ‚Äî essential for executive dashboards and BI tools.
